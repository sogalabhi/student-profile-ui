This project is a high-fidelity UI/UX design for a centralized **Student Profile Portal** for NITK (National Institute of Technology Karnataka). The portal allows students to manage and showcase their academics, clubs, research work, internships, skills, projects, and more. The platform also serves as a comprehensive database for the institution to track and maintain student profiles efficiently.

## Features

### For Students:
- **Dashboard**: Personal dashboard to manage profile data, view profile completeness, and recent activity.
- **Academic Section**: Add and display GPA, grades, courses, and academic achievements.
- **Clubs & Activities**: Showcase involvement in clubs, leadership roles, and extracurricular activities.
- **Internships & Research**: Display internships, research projects, and publications with details.
- **Skills & Projects**: Showcase technical, soft skills, and project work, organized in categories.
- **Profile Completeness Meter**: Visual indicator of profile completion to help students track the progress of their profile.
- **Admin Approval**: When a student adds a project or research work, the admin must review and approve it before it becomes visible on the public profile.
- **Privacy Control**: Toggle switches for students to choose which sections of their profile are public.

### For the Institution:
- **Institution Dashboard**: View, search, and filter student profiles by various attributes (e.g., GPA, skills, internships).
- **Comprehensive Database**: Maintain a complete record of student data with easy access to profiles.
- **Admin Approval System**: Review and approve student-added content (e.g., projects, research) before it is displayed on their public profile.
